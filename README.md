# Texture-Pack-Template
A Template for voxel game texture packs built to keep things consistent and descriptive in the community


Uses [minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest) worlds and fairly generic blocks for multi-game compatibility.


# How to Use
## Step one:
Take the screenshots using the worlds given. Make sure your screenshots taken are 1235 pixels wide and 1000 pixels high Note(if you moved on accident then just copy the saved positions and look directions in a text file next to the world folder, and paste them into your character text file in the worlds folder then restart the world)

## Step two:
Open your screenshots in your chosen image editor along with the TemplateBG.png provided.

## Step three:
Paste the screenshots into the Template image and scale them down to 615X498, then move them to their equivalent locations.

## Step four:
Export the final image as a new file for your use.
